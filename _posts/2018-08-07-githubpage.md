## Hi there,

I recently found out that you can easily build your own page using Github.
Building this page does not require a lot of time and no need to be highly skilled in programming to do so.

Basically, Git allows you to control what happened to the scripts you have on your computer. Github is quite similar but do it online and allows other people to look at your scripts. Github also allows you to create a webpage.


Just take a look there [Pages Github link](https://pages.github.com),
scroll down and follow the instruction to create your own webpage.


Take a look at this video [Setup Github page in 20 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M) to learn how to control a few features.


If you want to have an access to your Github page directly from your computer, look at that one [Learn Git in 20 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c)
