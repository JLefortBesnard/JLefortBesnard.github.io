## Hi there,

I recently found out that you can easily build your own page using GitHub.
Building a GitHub page does not require a lot of time and no need to be highly skilled in programming to do so.


### Basic stuff you need to know

Git is an open-source *version control system*. It allows you to store the modifications you made on local scripts. In short, it lets you know what changed in your scripts.

GitHub is an *web-based hosting service*. It allows you to store your scripts online and other people can make changes on them. Those modifications are also stored and you decide to apply them or not.

GitHub also allows you to create a webpage.

### Create your GitHub page

Just take a look there [Pages GitHub link](https://pages.github.com),
scroll down and follow the instruction to create your own webpage. It's quite intuitive.


Scroll down a bit and select "User or organization site". Then to the question: "What git client are you using", select "A terminal" if you know how to use Git and then follow the instruction. You can also learn Git in 20 min there [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c).

Select "GitHub Desktop" otherwise and follow what is written.


In sum:
1. Create a new repository on you GitHub account named "username.github.io" (where username has to be the GitHub username you used to log in)
2. Click on "Set up in Desktop" and save the project
3. Create an index file as written at the bottom of this [page](https://pages.github.com), commit and save. And that's it, you are done!


If you want to have a very nice page which looks like a website, I suggest you take a look at this video [Setup GitHub page in 20 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWrcgHwSG8M) to learn how to control a few features.
