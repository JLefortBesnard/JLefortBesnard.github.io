Currently finishing my Ph.D. at the RWTH university of Aachen in Germany, I am an avid user of python & machine learning. Working with different types of data (mostly fMRI, MRI, and questionnaire), I am a fan of open science, free software, and open source.

My main interests are statistical learning, neuroimaging and psychiatry. So far, I mostly focused on schizophrenia and autism.
