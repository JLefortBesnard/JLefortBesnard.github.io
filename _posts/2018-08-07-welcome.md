## Welcome!

Currently finishing my Ph.D. at the university of Aachen in Germany, I became a python & machine learning fan a few years ago. I'm in for open science, free software, and open source.

I love running and hiking, reading and programming. My main interests are statistical learning, psychiatry, and geopolitics.
