Hi there,
My name is Jeremy Lefort-Besnard. I'm currently finishing my Ph.D. in computational neuroscience in the RWTH university, Aachen, Germany.

My first project was about quantifying the importance of the dysfunction of each segregated default mode network (DMN) subregions 
in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia using sparse inverse covariance.
Different shades of default mode disturbance in schizophrenia: Subnodal covariance estimation in structure and function (Lefort-Besnard et al 2018, HBM)

For the second project, we wanted to predict schizophrenia severity based on hidden structure of a clinical questionnaire (PANSS) using machine learning tools.
Our manuscript is currently under review.
For my last project regarding the Ph.D., we are currently exploring the questionnaire ADOS and ADI-R used in the research on autism.
