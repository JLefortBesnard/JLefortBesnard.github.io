<p>Hi there,</p> 

<p>My name is Jeremy Lefort-Besnard. I'm currently finishing my Ph.D. in computational neuroscience in the RWTH University, Aachen, Germany.</span>
My first project was about quantifying the importance of the dysfunction of each segregated default mode network (DMN) subregions </span>
in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia using sparse inverse covariance.</p>
<p>Different shades of default mode disturbance in schizophrenia: Subnodal covariance estimation in structure and function (Lefort-Besnard et al 2018, HBM) </span>
PDF: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.23870</p>
<p>For the second project, we wanted to predict schizophrenia severity based on hidden structure of a clinical questionnaire (PANSS) using machine learning tools.</span>
Our manuscript is currently under review.</p>
<p>For my last project regarding the Ph.D., we are currently exploring the questionnaire ADOS and ADI-R used in the research on autism. </p>
