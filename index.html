<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hi there,</span></p> 

<p><span style="color: #000000;">My name is Jeremy Lefort-Besnard. I'm currently finishing my Ph.D. in computational neuroscience in the RWTH University, Aachen, Germany.</span>
My first project was about quantifying the importance of the dysfunction of each segregated default mode network (DMN) subregions </span>
in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia using sparse inverse covariance.</span>
Different shades of default mode disturbance in schizophrenia: Subnodal covariance estimation in structure and function (Lefort-Besnard et al 2018, HBM) </span>
PDF: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.23870</span>
For the second project, we wanted to predict schizophrenia severity based on hidden structure of a clinical questionnaire (PANSS) using machine learning tools.</span>
Our manuscript is currently under review.</span>
For my last project regarding the Ph.D., we are currently exploring the questionnaire ADOS and ADI-R used in the research on autism. </span>
Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Dr. Bzdok (RWTH Aachen) and Prof. Dr. Bassett (University of Pennsylvania)</span>
