I am currently finishing a Ph.D. in the field of computational neuroscience under the supervision of professor Bzdok at the University of Aachen (RWTH) in Germany and professor Bassett at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) in the US.

My Ph.D. is supervised by academics from very different fields (medicine, computer science, and physics). Working with these very inspiring researchers really made clear that I have a deep interest for combination of rigorous methodology and innovating approach to investigate psychopathologies.

In December 2015, I began to work on the default mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. We exploited novel machine-learning techniques to complement previous researches in the field. Our methodology further enabled quantifying the structure-function correspondence by analogous analyses on resting-state connectivity fluctuations and brain volume variability. As a second Ph.D. project, we opted for a paradigm that would improve clinical workflows since personalized medicine is an emerging agenda in psychiatry. We decided to deploy a comprehensive analytic strategy that emphasized prediction performance and direct clinical relevance using the PANSS, the most widely used questionnaire to assess schizophrenia symptoms severity.
