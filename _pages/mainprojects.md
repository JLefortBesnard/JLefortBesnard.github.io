## Different shades of the default mode in schizophrenia

The overwhelming majority of mental disorders show disturbance in the default mode network (DMN). Yet, mental disorders with diverging clinical phenotypes are unlikely to be caused by an identical pathophysiological mechanism. Our study resolves previous inconsistencies on network disruption in schizophrenic patients by delineating aberration of top-level DMN control on subordinate multi-modal networks using meta-analytic atlases and pattern-learning algorithms in a large multi-site dataset (n=325).


We find that DMN activity does not obey the neuroanatomical boundaries of Brodmann's 100-year-old cytoarchitectonic atlas. We therefore deploy detailed topographical definitions using a recently completed DMN subnode atlas.

The DMN nodes are subdivided into 12 ROIs accounting for the distinct subnodes in the DMN that were recently established. According to this prior work, the functional core of the DMN likely corresponds especially to its blue and red subnodes ("DMN proper").


We hypothesized that many prior inconsistencies in DMN findings can be explained by the reliance on simple linear correlations between node pairs. We therefore exploited novel machine-learning techniques that are able to incorporate all node-node relations, thereby accounting for third-party influences on each coupling relation. Our methodology further enabled quantifying the structure-function correspondence by analogous analyses on resting-state connectivity fluctuations and brain volume variability.


This systems neuroscience approach reveals that the backbone of the DMN does not drive brain dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Instead, our results highlight dysregulated coupling between the highly associative DMN and the multi-modal dorsal attention (DAN) and saliency (SN) networks. Distinct disease mechanisms were identified by structural covariation analyses emphasizing aberrant DMN-SN coupling, whereas functional covariation analyses emphasized aberrant DMN-DAN coupling. Our computational investigation at increased spatial resolution proposes targeting the DMN in relation to other canonical networks to approach a future of personalized medicine in psychiatry.

## Patterns of Schizophrenia Symptoms

Here, we opted for a paradigm that would improve clinical workflows since personalized medicine is an emerging agenda in psychiatry.


The clinical symptoms presented by schizophrenia patients have long been described as highly heterogeneous. The various behavioral manifestations measured in clinical questionnaires are unlikely to comply with its categorical division into positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Our study resolves several of the previous inconsistencies between clinical symptom patterns observed in clinical practice as measured by the PANSS questionnaire using advanced machine-learning analyses in a large multi-site dataset (n=218).


We therefore adopted machine-learning techniques allowing for a more complete exploration of schizophrenia patient characteristics. As a distinctive property compared to previous studies, our methodology enabled the exploration of predictive patterns of schizophrenia severity in the PANSS.


This comprehensive analytic framework revealed a negative as well as a moderate and a severe profile of schizophrenia patients underlying the psychopathology emphasizing the relevance of schizophrenia subtype differentiation. These isolated patients profiles give new insights to search for effective treatments in specific subpopulation of schizophrenia patients.


Furthermore, our approach identified a small subset of 11 PANSS items with highest performance in distinguishing presence and absence of schizophrenia symptoms.

*Figure 1. Isolating the most predictive items in the PANSS questionnaire.*
A predictive pattern-learning algorithm (sparse logistic regression) was used to automatically identify item subsets in the PANSS questionnaire that are most informative about telling mild versus severe schizophrenia apart in future patients.

The here isolated more predictive questionnaire items may be useful to make patient-specific prediction about disease trajectory, drug response, and psychosis risk but also to obtain a fast assessment of schizophrenia symptoms severity. In sum, our study supplemented previous research by allowing exploration of discrete disease definition and prediction of the pathology severity based on behavioral manifestations of single individuals.


Collectively, our computational investigation proposes targeting subtle item combinations rather than the three long-trusted symptom categories (i.e., positive, negative, or cognitive symptoms) to approach a future of personalized medicine in psychiatry. Our results might lead to procedural streamlining and enhanced clinical and economic effectiveness.
