## CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS AND PUBLICATIONS

### First author
  * 2018, Under review
*"Patterns of schizophrenia symptoms: hidden structure underlying the PANSS
questionnaire"*


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We predicted schizophrenia severity based on the hidden structure of a clinical
questionnaire (PANSS) using a broad machine learning toolbox including sparse logistic regression and latent-factor approaches
  * 2018, Human Brain Mapping
*"Different shades of the default mode in schizophrenia, subnodal covariance estimation
in structure and function"*
[Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.23870)


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We quantified the importance of the dysfunction of each segregated default mode network
subregions in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia using sparse inverse covariance
on structural and resting-states functional brain imaging modalities
