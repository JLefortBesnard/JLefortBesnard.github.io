  <h2>Why did I quit FB</h2>
  <p align="justify">It was an easy decision to take but tough to make
  it happen. Facebook is <b>addictive</b>. A few years ago, I decided
  to stop posting stuff about my private life and to only post about
  topics that I found interesting. The second step was not to use the
  &quot;like&quot; button for any private related post such as my FB
  friends' new profile picture or FB friends' activity but only related
  to interesting idea that could improve the world such as stuff about
  veganism, climate change, feminism, and so on... The third step was
  to unfriend all the not-so-known FB friends. The last step was about
  to decide a specific date to delete my account, stick to it and to
  write a final post about saying bye bye and giving my email to those
  interested.</p>
  <p align="justify">Here we are, I am out. And it feels great.</p>
  <p align="justify">I was addict. Checking my account at least once a
  day. Checking notifications as soon as notifying them. Looking at
  photos of friends and friends of friends. In other words: <b>wasting
  time</b>.</p>
  <p align="justify">Yes, I did follow several pages of my favorite
  people and associations but still, the ratio of relevant information
  compared to noise was quite low. When I read a book, there isn't any
  cat picture popping up, nor a link to a video about what Trump
  recently did. I stay focus and my attention doesn't get wasted.</p>
  <p align="justify">I know we need breaks. But checking Facebook is
  not having a real break. I didn't feel refreshed after 5 minutes of
  scrolling down. I don't really know what the goal was, I guess I was
  trying not to get bored, or not to think at all. Sometimes satisfying
  a curiosity I had about this girl I met in college or what this guy
  became after so many years. Or I wanted to follow what my real
  friends recently did (instead of asking them) or follow what this
  association recently went through.</p>
  <p align="justify">There are some advantages of using FB: you can
  easily invite many people to your party and stay in touch with people
  you would forget otherwise (I'm not sure this is really an
  advantage). But for what price?!</p>
  <p align="justify">I won't talk much about <b>FB privacy issue</b>
  because it's everywhere on the cloud. But still, this should be your
  main motivation to get rid of FB: trust and privacy issues, continual
  changes in format, sponsored posts, increased advertisements, selling
  of your personal data and attention, etc... The list is quite long,
  for FB, *you are* the product. And indeed, just think about it for a
  minute. We are telling some random people (I'm not talking about your
  FB friends here) what we like or don't, who we like or don't, who we
  know, basically our complete social network. This is crappy. I bet
  you know that one: after a few likes, FB actually found out about
  your race, IQ, sexuality, substance use, personality and political
  views even if you had chosen not to reveal that information (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.short" target="_blank">source</a>).
  As a good reminder,
  every information you give to the GAFAM and the 2 most famous
  operating systems are leaking information to the governments (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks" target="_blank">Wikileaks</a>). It is a -big-
  deal.</p>
  <p align="justify">FB is also very tricky. You just agree with
  yourself for a 5 min check, but it turns into 30 min or more of new
  links, videos, and so on... Time is precious, there are so many
  greater things we could do!</p>
  <p align="justify">All of these notifications checking, posts liking,
  comments answers, picture tagging, this is for sure a waste of time
  but even more sadly: another side effect is the demotivation on doing
  actual great things. Do you remember these time lying on your couch
  thinking about doing something real but... wait.. a last scroll,
  please.</p>
  <p align="justify">Quite recently, some researchers have shown that
  the social network is one of the most important variables in
  measuring happiness. Thus I thought that having a big FB friends list
  would make me happier. And it did. For about a second. FB friends are
  NOT friends. I know it's obvious but it's always good to remember
  such fact: friends are people you talk to, you meet, you laugh with,
  you make fun of, you show your love to. I wasn't doing such thing
  with 95% of my FB friends.</p>
  <p align="justify">What about all these people you know you won't
  have any news from anymore? You can still keep in touch on Signal
  (ethical version of Whatsapp) or email, or even better, write them a
  letter! Sure, I know, getting rid of your FB friends feels a bit like
  giving up a book you enjoyed. On the other hand, it frees your
  friendship shelf for new stories. Also, a few days after you delete
  your account, you won't care much anymore and you'll realize how
  unimportant these fake connections actually were. You will then start
  to focus on what really matters.</p>

  <p align="justify">In sum, get your privacy back, get your time back,
  get your care about ethics and others back. Do something good for you
  and the next generation: <b>donâ€™t give up your freedom to
  short-term rewards.</b></p>
