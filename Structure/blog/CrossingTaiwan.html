   <h2>
    Crossing Taiwan from the extreme northern to the extreme southern tip through the jungle and mountains
   </h2>
   <p align="justify">
    I have a new project in mind: I want to cross Taiwan. More than 700km of hikes through the jungle and mountains (up to 3900m). Click below to get the lastest news about my position and pathway.

   <div id="intro" style="display:none">
    <p align="justify">
     My first idea was to hike through the highest mountains and cross each national park (
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Mountain_Range" target="_blank">
      Central Mountain Range -aka Chungyang Range-
     </a>
     , ‰∏≠Â§ÆÂ±±ËÑà).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">
     <img id="minimaps" border="2" name="map" src="../../Images/images_blog/crossTaiwanmap.png"/>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
     But two main challenges made me change my mind. On the one hand, the need to book a mountain permit. Access to the national parks is limited to protect nature. One should therefore prepare his/her hike with specific dates and pathways. Eventually, I decided that I would rather keep some freedom about my speed and the path I want to follow. On the other hand, access to food is rather difficult on the high peaks. I would need to supply at least 10 days of reserve rations (if not more). I would also face some troubles with charging my phone (for the GPS/maps) and weather forecast (the typhoon season will start soon).
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
     Therefore, I am doing this project in a different way that leaves me more freedom. Each day, I will plan ahead the next three days and update it every evening depending on the weather forecast, the need for electricity and food, my mood and wishes, with particular emphasis on
     <i>
      avoiding roads
     </i>
     , looking for the
     <i>
      most natural spots
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      aiming south
     </i>
     . Oh, and if possible at least 10kms a day and as high in the mountains as possible.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
     After several weeks of training in the Taiwannese jungle, in the high mountains, in the rain or under a blazing sun, learning about snakes and leeches, packing and unpacking my  hiking backpack, setting up and packing up my tent, preparing a vegan hiking diet adjusted to the expected effort, I finally feel ready both physically and mentally. I leave Monday 13th of July from

      The journey to the south started with a long road. My skin was quickly damp with sweat.  I entered the jungle in the late afternoon. I found a beautiful waterfall and faced a big (around 1 meter) and scary greyish snake. I then started to walk like an elephant to avoid another such meeting! I eventually found a good spot to set up the tent near water to wash myself, cook and drink.

      2 next days easy, I stay in Taipei moving south slowly until Wednesday. It feels weird to be so close to my home but not going in. But that's the project. Go south or go home! Hopefully, I got wonderful support!

      After a lovely evening and morning, I left Taipei at around 2pm. I climbed into the jungle but quickly got back to the road. I followed the river for a long while under a scorching sun. I finally reached a tiny city. I ate there but could not find any place to set up the tent so I decided to move forward.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      It was late and dark, I was dirty, sweaty and still looking for a place to sleep. A scooter stopped next to me as I was walking and a young taiwanese asked me if I needed help or if she could drop me somewhere. After explaining my situation, she suggested me to keep walking until a trail entrance not too far from there. I reached that point quite late. There was a temple nearby, a few dogs ran after me and barked at me. A woman came out and I asked if I could set up my tent and use the faucet to wash myself. Keyi, she said (you can). I fell asleep while the dogs were still barking.

Too bad for the coffee I was dreaming about. I found a place to sleep near a temple. While I was setting up the tent, a group of dogs ran after me, barking and excited to have found an easy prey. I was happy to have my walking sticks with me so that I could wipe the road in front of me to keep them at bay. A woman left her home after a little while (enough for me to start sweating from fear) and started yelling at them. The dogs went quiet in no time. What charisma!

I started walking again with enthousiasm. The trail was very pretty but I got lost many times. It was very steep but it was a skyline and above 1000 meters so a slight wind very refreshing was blowing. Nice surprise: I reached a trail that Juliette and I have already hiked last year. I spent the night there and fell asleep dreaming of that hike.

      I took a coffee break at the 7-11 and took time to plan the following. I could reach the East part but I need to cross a national park and thus ask for a permit, or walk only on roads. Anyway, it would take me many days and getting food supply would be tough. Also, once on the highest montains of Taiwan, I would need a month to reach the end of the chain given my speed. To be honest, I am dreaming about computers those days. Therefore, I opted for finding an internet cafe instead. I looked on the map, the closest one is at 43kms if I take the trails. The shortest path would be to take the roads, it would then be 39kms. I could do that in two days. Or, I could walk a bit tonight and do an 'almost' marathon walking. I would then be in the internet cafe the next day. I decided to give it a try.

      I woke up slowly and started my walking marathon. On the way, a biker stopped and gave me two taiwannese pears very sweet and juicy: a perfect surprise! I took a break at 2pm because it started raining quite a lot. At around 3pm, I started walking again painfully. It was still raining but the idea of geeking that night was cheering me up! A dozen of kilometers before the internet cafe, I was very thirsty and didn't have any water left. I had already eaten all my fruits, my feet were very sore, and I was completely wet. I then looked up and saw a biker, Pei Hsiu, waiting for me and handing me a bottle of water. In Taiwan, I have the feeling that my wishes are granted before I actually wish them!

      I reached the city quite late and very tired. Sad surprise: the internet cafe was permanently closed. To boost my motivation, I looked up for a plan B. Taichung is 18 kms away and the internet cafes overthere must be open. I decided to reach Taichung the next day, after a walking marathon, 18 kms should be fine, right? I would take an hostel to heal the blisters under my feet and rest a bit. I found a park and pitched the tent in the dark while fighting off mosquitos. The night was quite smooth except for that drunk dude who aggressively wanted me to spend a night at his place for 1000 NTD (around 30 euros). I had to get out of the tent and insist for him to leave me alone. He eventually left zigzagging with his bike.

Pei Hsiu dropped me at another addess. This one was open, what a relief! I spent the next day there.

      Juliette was about to go back to her life in Taipei that day. We spent a lazy enjoyable morning. The beginning of the trail was 40kms away from Shueli on a monotonous road (though with a pretty view all the way long). I am afraid to reach the trail entrance very tired, and this trail is famous to be potentially dangerous. Therefore, I decided to take the bus and to save me from these 40kms. I said bye to Juliette. We will meet again soon. Let's go!

      I reached Dongpu in no time. I went to the police office to validate my permit and asked if I could sleep there. Nope. I thus decided to start the trail a bit, directly. There is a temple a bit further up. Once at the temple, I was warmly welcome. People even gave me guavas, delicious but adding weight to my bag...

      Furthermore, it was a sunny day and I felt great! I reached the shelter on the early afternoon. It started to be cloudy. I decided to keep walking anyway. That time, I quitted the well groomed Japanese trail for a steep slope and wild trail. I reached a place next to a tiny river to set up the tent exactly when it started raining. I then spent the evening doing laundry, body washing party, diner, reading and sleeping. I woke up several times that night because it was quite cold at 3000m. Quite a change from the jungle! At least, when it was not raining, I could see the stars. I could see so many there, it was very pretty.

      I was looking at Yushan, the highest peak of Taiwan. I was thinking back to my first trial to hike it almost a year ago. At around 3750m, I got altitude sickness (nausea and severe headache) and had to head back down. Since then, the desire of reaching Yushan's peak became even stronger.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      I checked my food supply. I could hike Yushan's peak if I don't eat too much and if I walk fast. But it's a major detour, with big vertical drops, and I would be out of the permit time limit. Eventually, I decided not to hike it this time. But I will later! Thus I stayed on the Batongguan Japanese Era Crossing Trail as expected.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      I went down from the mountain's peak to reach the well traced trail again. The route up to the next summit was quite steep and pretty, passing trough rainforests over streams up to the shelter I was aiming for: A wonderful place to sleep.

      I was happy to sleep in a shelter since the night was quite cold. During the night, I went out to pee and what a surprise to see that the clouds disappeared replaced by stars and shooting stars (we are mid August). I think I've never seen so many. This shelter was indeed quite far from city lights thus I could see more stars than usual.

I was forced to continue. I kept walking up to Jiashin, 4kms from the trail entrance. I decided to stop there instead of reaching the trail entrance because I was not sure there would be water overthere and it started to be dark. I met local people working in the area. They offered me to try a local whisky. I said I was feeling like a tea for now. It was not a good excuse. I went sleeping after three glasses of three different bottles of local whiskies, dizzy and happy! I reached the East, wohoo!

      Michelle told me about the Taitung International Balloon Festival which is happening in Luye, 40kms from Fuli in the direction of Taitung. I thought that I could maybe make it in two days. After exchanging our Line ID and sharing a coffee together with Michelle (who came waking me up that morning with a breakfast!), I started aiming toward Luye. Just one thing, if one day, you are around Fuli, you should go try her special recipe in her Painting Cafe: The lemon coffee!

      I walked under a heavy rain. I was quickly wet from head to toe! Hopefully, Taiwanese people along the road frequently honked at me, cheered me up and sometimes even stopped to give me food or something to drink.

      Eventually, I did walk the 40kms. I reached the festival late that night. It's a tourist attraction so it is not allowed to set up the tent except in an expensive camping. There are cameras everywhere so I didn't dare to set the tent anyway. I found a bench and slept with mosquitoes but with a great view on the stars. My legs were sore after my second walking marathon but I was happy and feeling good!

      My feet were sore. I got blisters. I didn't want to walk anymore. My socks got holes in them. One of my underpants was frayed and would soon be unwearable. But I was soon reaching the south!

      I felt like I should take one more day of rest but my desire to reach the south quickly was too big. Thus I left Taitung in the early afternoon and decided to walk slowly.

     <p align="justify">
      I walked in the city to avoid lengthening my trip (going next to the coast directly would add a dozen of kilometers). I expected to follow the East coast the next day so I could bear a bit of city roads. I took a shaved-ice break. Shaved-ice in Taiwan is a bowl of fruits covered with  crushed ice. Vegan and refreshing dessert! I finally reached my sleeping spot. A great place with tap water and view on the ocean. There was a little shelter. A storm was coming. I chose to sleep out in the open and to look at the thunderstorm.

      That morning, I was walking on the road but with a wonderful view on the Pacific ocean. I had set a goal to walk until the trail entrance at about 30kms from my location. After walking 10kms, I passed next to a truck that was parked on the side of the road. The driver called me: "Where are you going? This road is dangerous, come, I will drop you where you wanna go". It didn't take long for me to get on his truck.

      I took off my shoes regularily. I was hesitant to cross the river with my shoes on to save time and energy but I didn't want to have my shoes wet to hike the mountains the next day. The water was almost warm, I couldn't wait to take a swim. Soon, it started raining a bit. It was time to set up the tent. It started raining quite a lot when I finally found a flat place. The heavy rain surprised me and most of my stuff got wet. Nevermind, it would dry the next day. After establishing the camp, I went for a swim.  The water level was rising because of the storm. I was wondering if I should set the tent a bit further but my lazyness decided that it was okay.
     </p>
     <p align="justify">
      Night had come and I dug myself into the sleeping bag. I heard rockfalls around me. The surrounding mountains were slowly collapsing because of the river. I was first startling, jumping at the noise of each rockslide, until those sounds finally became routine. I also heard monkeys not far. Did I let some food outside? I was not sure. I was tired. I didn't care much. I felt asleep, pleasantly cradled by the rain hitting the tent.

      I was first happy that I would have to climb. I started full of energy and confidence. After climbing half of the wall, I realized that it was not an easy trail. Reaching the three-quarters of the wall, I was wondering if I should give up. Some rocks would detach from the very steep slope and crash down. I felt scared. I was not far from the top. I decided to give up. I started to climb down but quickly changed my mind. I was close to the top, I could do it. I finally reached it, sweat on my brow.

      I saw a trail flag on a tree. I was therefore indeed on the trail. The mountain was collapsing because of the water forming a V around it. The trail was also disappearing. I followed it for a little while. The ground collapsed from time to time. I was not entirely reassured. At some point, lacking balance, I grabbed a tree which I thought was firmly rooted but eventually was dead. The tree trunk broke, beating my head and making me lean dangerously to the side. Enough is enough. I decided to retrace my steps. I looked for an easy way to go down. Vertical walls everywhere. I needed to take the same path I took to climb up. I didn't want that. I took a break. I took time to think. I finally took a decision. I would climb down but without my bag. I rolled the fragile objects neatly into my clothes and my bag into my poncho. Good luck dear bag. I let my bag fall slowly off the slope. It quickly gained speed, continued its freefall jumping around, loosed my water bottle which in turn started its own freefall. They finally ended their trips almost at the end of the slope. I was hoping my descent to be smoother. I planned my descent. I needed to do two little detours to get back my water bottle and my bag. I started to climb down. Controlling my breath, going slowly but surely. I felt raindrop. I started to be anxious. I took a deep breath and started climbing down again. I gave myself quite a scare a few times but eventually reached my battered water bottle and my bag quickly after. I was almost there. Couldn't wait for the end!

I offered myself a bit of cheat: I took the train and got off two stations later. I set up the tent. The rain stopped but the wind was strong. Perfect weather to dry all my stuff. I felt asleep weary after that long day.

      Back on the road. Nevermind for crossing East to West. I started to feel like reaching the south, finishing this project and getting back to a normal life. There was still a long wild hike along the coast waiting for me. The trail entrance was 10 kms away. I started walking with sore feet and legs but the view was fantastic. I took a break at a bus stop. The bus came. I took it and got off one station later. I started walking again toward the trail entrance. A man parked his car next to me and started talking in Chinese. He was chewing betel nuts (the local tabacco which gives a red mouth). We didn't understand each other but I thought he wanted to drive me a bit. I got in his car. He started driving for 200 meters and parked... in the police station. I could feel that I was losing some patience. A police officer came out and they started talking together. The police officer made a phone call. A second officer came. They talked all together. The second officier called someone and handed me the phone. One of his friends whom spoke English. I explained her the situation. I handed back the phone. I waited while they were talking. The police officer looked at me and said byebye. He was gently asking me to leave. I left directly.

      I think the guy just wanted to help me out and to drive me somewhere. But since we could not understand each other, he drove me to the police station thinking that they would help for the translation. Then the police officer called his friend thinking he would speak English. Then the second officer called his friend to help for the translation. Still, a bit like a Kafkaesque situation!

     <p align="justify">
      I started hiking again. I am now walking on a pebble beach. I started to enjoy hiking again despite the blisters

      The trail turned into a dirt road. I crossed a small river. This time, I took off my shoes to avoid getting them wet. I saw a small hut with two men standing further on the trail. They looked like policemen. I kept walking until facing them. "You can't pass without authorization". I was a little stunned. Especially since that morning at the police station, they confirmed me that it was possible to cross. I tried negotiating. "You shall not pass". I gave up.

      I checked the map. No choice but walking on the roads until the southernmost point. I was fed up. I started hitchhiking. A car stopped soon after. They dropped me next to the police station I was that morning. I kept a low profile, I didn't want to explain the situation one more time. I started hitchhiking again. A dude whom was eating in a nearby restaurant asked me about my destination. I told him the western part of the island. Soon after, he picked me up with his mini-van and drove me there. I could see the China see. I then took a bus toward the nearest scooter rental agency. I rented a scooter for 24 hours and drove south. I parked the scooter 500 meters away from the southernmost tip of Taiwan. I walked slowly to the end of my project. While walking, I remembered the whole trip, each night, each trail, each mountain, each person I met. I wondered what I have learned. I wondered what would come next. I saw people around me surprised to see me with such a big backpack. I was now seeing the ocean. Only a few meters left...

      Et voil√†. After a month and a half, more than 600 kilometers through jungle, mountains and roads, I reached the south! Juliette sent me a package with clean clothes and comfy shoes. What a great idea! I threw away my underwear frayed around the edges and my destroyed socks. I put the old clothes in my bag. I could smell that my handwashing was not as efficient as a machine washing. I grabbed a drink, I raised my glass in a toast to Taiwan and fell asleep with a head full of memories.

    <p align="justify">
     I strongly recommend making a small bottle hanger in front of the bag to avoid having to take off the bag for a water break. It also helps to control water consumption. I also recommend not to bring more than 2 pairs of underpants/socks and 2 tops. This choice indeed implies to wash them every night so you must find water. Sometimes, things won't be dry in the morning, but you would be soaked in sweat in half an hour anyway. I didn't lack anything and I think everything I brought was useful. I didn't weight my bag but I would say 15/16kgs max including food and water.
