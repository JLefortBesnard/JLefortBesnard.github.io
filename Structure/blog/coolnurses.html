  <h2>How cool are they?</h2>

  <p align="justify">The family of my infected mate, Martin (aka case 84), recently started a famous game. They try to reproduce a famous painting with their own means. They challenged Martin to make one from his isolation room in Taipei hospital</p>
  <p align="justify">Martin accepted the challenge and here is his work:</p>

  </p>

  <p align="justify">The funny part is that while preparing his picture, Martin made a mess in his room. Looking at him through the camera (we are filmed 24/7 for security reason), the nurses started to worry about him and asked him if he was okay or if he was going crazy!</p>
 <p align="justify">After Martin explained the quirky situation, this is how the nurses reacted:</p>

  </p>

  <p align="justify">How cool is that?! Seeing this pic really made my day!</p>

  <p align="justify">Martin challenged me as well, I also made a mess in my room but eventually got my shot:</p>

  </p>

<p align="justify">Then I decided to challenge the nurses from Hsinchu hospital where I am locked down. And they really got into it!</p> 
<p align="justify">Here is their contribution:</p>

<p align="justify">Living in Taiwan is AWESOME, even as covid-19 positive!</p>

<p align="justify">Please, leave a comment to tell which team (Taipei or Hsinchu) has the best pic!</p>
