    How to host your own HTML website without Wordpress on Bluehost.com
   </h2>
   <p align="justify">
    Given my goal of learning PHP and SQL, I rented a shared server on Bluehost. I wanted to create my own website from scratch using HTML. I first hosted it using
    <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">
     Github page
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/" target="_blank">
     Gitlab page
    </a>
    , but these options only allow for static websites, and I wanted to interact with my readers through comments or other PHP scripts. Therefore, I opted for the cheapest offer from Bluehost since it includes all I need. Why Bluehost? Well, reviews said it was a good option among others, but there are many hosts out there, just type "list of web hosting services" on your search engine.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    See the picture below for the option I chose. This price is only if you subscribe for three years. I took only one year thus itâ€™s a bit more expensive, around 6 dollars per month.

    Once your account created, the only thing you have to do is to delete whatâ€™s inside the "public_html" folder because thatâ€™s where the Wordpress site would be stored. I suggest you compress it and save it locally before deleting it, just in case you want it later. Once the "public_html" folder empty, you can store your website inside. It should soon be online accessible through the domain name you picked when registering.

    You can follow the above steps through 3 ways:
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    1. Using FTP connection (

     How to setup FTP using Filezilla
    </a>
    )
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    2. Directly going to Advanced/FILES/File Manager after logging into bluehost.com which will bring you to all the files you got in your shared server (including the "public_html" folder)
   </p>

    3. Using ssh connection which allows you to transfer files directly from your terminal which makes everything easier (

    )

    That's it, enjoy the process!
