    About fasting
   </h2>
   <p align="justify">
    I am fasting every Tuesday since a few months. I don‚Äôt eat
  anything from Monday evening to Wednesday morning. I just drink water
  and tea (without milk, honey or sugar). I recently switched to a 24h
  fasting instead, thus I eat again Tuesday evening. There is a
  pragmatic reason for this: sleeping when being hungry is tough thus I
  was tired on Wednesday therefore not productive enough.

    I‚Äôve always been in good shape and nothing changed since I
  started fasting. I just have a feeling that my body regulates itself
  more easily in terms of digestion. Thus I cannot really say that
  there are
    <i>
     intrinsic
    </i>
    positive effects.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    However, I noticed a bunch of positive side effects:
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    # Fasting taught me to develop strategies to resist unhealthy food
  (fries, candies, etc.). I have learned how to control myself and to
  resist temptations way more easily. Nowadays, it‚Äôs quite easy for
  me to say ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äústop‚Äù to myself.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    # Fasting taught me that eating 3 times a day is neither vital nor
  necessarily optimum. I can even do as much sport as I do in every
  other day after 24h fasting.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    # I enjoy way more every single bite and I eat more slowly.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    # Starving helps me to reconsider daily life problems and take
  things more easily.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    # Each Tuesday is a challenge and I love competing with myself.
  It‚Äôs a very good way to

     get
  out of your comfort zone
    </a>
    . In other words, I get a lot of personal
  satisfaction from this fasting.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    # Each Tuesday, I‚Äôm very hungry. In order to think about
  something else, I focus more on my job. Each Tuesday, I am therefore
  way more productive than every other day!
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    Finally, I do recommend fasting if done with caution and for goals
  similar to mine. For example, I think it‚Äôs not a good way to lose
  weight. To answer your question more concretely, I didn‚Äôt notice
  any negative effect on my body and according to some studies, it
  might indeed be healthy (
