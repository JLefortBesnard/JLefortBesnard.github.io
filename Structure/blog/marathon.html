    Running a marathon for the first time
   </h2>

     May 2010.
    </b>
    I quit smoking and start running. I run about 10k
  twice a week. After a few competitions and meeting several inspiring
  marathoners, I register for a marathon in June 2012.
   </p>

    </b>
    I design a training plan: 3 runs a week. A
  long distance (at least 15k), a fun run (10k), and a cardio workout
  (interval run) per week. The motivation is in full swing! It feels
  easy. However, after a few weeks, the interval training starts to be
  painful.

    Interval run is really painful.

    I get back to interval runsâ€¦ Against my will.

    </b>
    And here we are: I get up and enjoy my breakfast
  early so that digestion is not done during the race. I warm up a bit.
  I feel great. Iâ€™m ready.
   </p>

     The starter's gun is fired. Letâ€™s do this!
    </b>
    My goal is to
  finish the race, in less than 4 hours would be very satisfying.

    I am faster than a bunch of runners. I love running, I
  feel great!

     15k.
    </b>
    Itâ€™s easier than I thought. You know what? Letâ€™s
  finish it in 3h30!

    Life is beautiful! I am awesome! Nothing can stop me!

    Look: a refreshment station. What about a bit of
  chocolate? Ok, letâ€™s get back on track. My legs hurt a bit. I
  should not have slowed down.
   </p>

    I'm in pain. Letâ€™s finish this race in 4h as
  planned. Yeah, 4 h is great.

   <p align="justify">
    <b>
     30k.
    </b>
    Wooo, it hurts. Ouch! My legs, my feet, ouch! Come on,
  donâ€™t give up! No, donâ€™t slow down. It's the 30th k, itâ€™s quite
  normal. Come on, let's finish this.
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    <b>
     35k.
    </b>
    Why am I doing this? Ok I quit. Yes, I quit, bye bye.
  I donâ€™t wanna run anymore, Iâ€™m done. Ouch! I am in pain. My legs,
  my feet, ouch! Everything hurts. Where is the fun?! Ouch!
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    <b>
     38k.
    </b>
    Seriously, WTF?! I ran only 3 more k, are you serious?
  There MUST be an error, it must be the end. How much? 5 more k to
  go?! I want to go home. Mom! Chocolate! I want my bed! Ouch!
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    <b>
     40k.
    </b>
    Okay, donâ€™t give up. 2 more k and it's over. Keep
  going. Shut up and run! Look, a photographer, smile! Ok, too bad for
  the photo. Keep going, look at the people around you, they are all
  brave, they are not whining. Come on dude. 6 months of training, no
  way you give up.
   </p>
   <hr/>
   <p align="justify">
    A few hundred meters from the end, many people around yell my name
  and encourage me. I run faster. Soon, it will be done. I run even
  faster. The finish line is just there. I fly.

   <p align="justify">
    I cross it. I slow down. I start walking. I canâ€™t feel my legs,
  neither my foot. Something really sweet is flowing through my veins.
  Itâ€™s done. I did it. I f*cking did it. Itâ€™s over. Itâ€™s over!
   </p>
   <p align="justify">
    I finished my first marathon in 4h14. Since then, I decided to run
  one every 3 years because it's a great sense of achievement and
  satisfaction but the training is really time and energy consumingâ€¦
  And I hate the interval training!
