  <h2>Do we use only 10% of our brain?</h2>
  <p align="justify">An original quote that has often been
  misinterpreted is:</p>
  <blockquote style="text-align: justify">&quot;<i>We are making use of
  only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources</i>&quot;
  (William James, 1908)</blockquote>
  <p align="justify">It has <b>nothing</b> to do with saying that we
  are using only 10% of our brain. Here are a few arguments why this is
  actually very much unlikely:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li/>
  <p align="justify">Removing (even small) parts of the brain
  	can have substantial effects on behaviours. Ex: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage">Phineas
  	P. Gage</a>, he survived a destruction of much of his brain's left
  	frontal lobe =&gt; known consequences: Profound effects on his
  	personality and behaviour.</p>
  </ul>
  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="../../Images/images_blog/percentagebrain_1.jpg" name="Image1" align="bottom" width="360" height="360" border="0"/>
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li/>
  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in">fMRI, EEG, MEG,
  	PET scans: the whole brain show temporal fluctuation in terms of
  	hemodynamic response, electrical activity, magnetic field and
  	chemical activity (even during rest and sleep). Some regions
  	increase their activity for a given task and period but it does not
  	mean that other parts are turned off, it only means that they are
  	less activated.</p>
  	<li/>
  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in">The brain, 2% of
  	the body weight, accounts for about 20% of the oxygen and calories
  	consumed by the body (Clark and Sokoloff, 1999). From an
  	evolutionary perspective, a brain that is 90% useless and that
  	expensive in terms energy intake is unlikely to develop.</p>
  	<li/>
  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Neuroplasticity:
  	Training and learning induce structural and functional changes in
  	the brain (Draganski et al, 2004). On the other hand: not enough
  	input and the synapses are eliminated (Hubel and Wiesel, 1964).
  	Therefore, it is very likely that the 90% useless would degenerate.</p>
  	<li/>
  <p align="justify">The brain is made of cells (mostly neurons
  	and glial cells): Some are useful for the structure of the brain,
  	some for the immunity, some for cleaning up, some for chemical
  	extracellular space regulation, some for &quot;feeding&quot;
  	neurons, some for transmitting information, etc... Again, it is very
  	unlikely that there is space for 90% of uselessness.</p>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">Given these arguments, I would say that it is
  very, very likely that we used 100% of our brain.</p>
  <p align="justify">However, you can improve both your physical
  (strength, flexibility, accuracy, cardiovascular, etc...) and mental
  (attention, memory, motivation, self-esteem, etc...) skills. The
  brain plasticity is not a myth:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li/>
  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Training and
  	learning induce structural and functional changes in the brain
  	(Draganski et al, 2004).</p>
  	<li/>
  <p align="justify">Studies on conditioning,
  	cognitivo-behavioral therapies, learning, sport psychology, etc...
  	are proofs that your behaviors, mood, cognitive skills, etc... are
  	partly controllable thus improvable.</p>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify"><b>Therefore, I bet that you are using 100% of
  your brain though you might not exploit 100% of your abilitiesâ€¦ :)</b></p>
