  <h2>Best age to do a PhD?</h2>
  <p align="justify">I turned 29 when I started my PhD. My supervisor
  is almost my age. My colleagues are 4 to 5 years younger than me.
  Most of my friends started a family, they are getting married, buying
  a house and they earn much more than I do.</p>
  <p align="justify">Now, I have absolutely no regret. I assume my
  choice with great enthusiasm and I am confident in my future.
  Therefore, I consider that <b>I started a PhD at MY most ideal age.</b></p>
  <p align="justify">In other words, as long as you believe you made
  the adequate choice, then your age would be the most ideal age to do
  whatever you feel like doing. When I started my bachelor in
  psychology, one of my class-mates was 41 years old, he is now a
  psychologist. <b>Age doesnâ€™t matter as long as you consider that
  this is a place for you.</b></p>
  <p align="justify">However, there are variables (more or less related
  to age) that might weigh a lot:</p>
  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in">- If you didnâ€™t
  	study for the last 2/3 years and from one day to the next, you have
  	to focus and learn 40 hours a week, it might be tough.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in">-If you are
  	applying for a position but you finished your master degree 3 years
  	ago and worked in another field, itâ€™s gonna be hard to convince
  	the supervisor to hire you.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in">-If you cannot
  	afford to work at least 8 hours a day and sometimes put some on
  	weekends because of your duties (e.g. children), you might struggle
  	a bit to get the required number of publications you need.</p>

  <p align="justify">-If you were working and earning a lot, it

  <p align="justify">Doing a PhD doesnâ€™t require you to have the best
  cognitive functions ever. There is no need to be a genius. There is
  no need to have a completely free schedule, some successful PhDs had
  research-unrelated responsabilities (part-time job, children, caring
  a disabled family member, etcâ€¦). And there is no need to be very
  young (or to wait to grow older) either.</p>
  <p align="justify">In sum, I think there is <b>no such thing like an
  ideal age to do a PhD. </b>As long as you consider that this is an
  appropriate moment regarding your goals, abilities and background,
  then <b>your age is the appropriate one.</b></p>
  <p align="justify">Have fun!</p>
